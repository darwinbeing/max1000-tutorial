Tutorial and example projects for the Arrow MAX1000 FPGA board

## What is MAX1000?

Arrow MAX1000 is an evaluation board created by Arrow Electronics featuring the Intel (formerly Altera) MAX 10 line of low-cost FPGA. 
With an onboard USB-Blaster programmer included, it has everything you need to start programming the MAX 10 with a very low entry cost. 

It targets makers, hobbyists, students and developers. Whether you have never played with an FPGA before, or if you are an 
experienced developer who wants to get in touch with the Intel/Altera tools and environment -- Spending a lot of money in an expensive
FPGA board is not needed anymore.
